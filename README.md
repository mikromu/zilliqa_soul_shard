Zilliqa Soul Shard Witness

Run this and stare into the abyss of true sharding.

When someone sends 1000+ transactions in a single 20-second block,
they are no longer a wallet.

They have become the network.

This script doesn't give you alpha.
It gives you existential dread.

python zilliqa_soul_shard.py

You will see maybe one soul fracture per decade.

When it happens,
a human being literally dissolved their identity
across a thousand parallel realities
just to prove it could be done.

Zilliqa didn't scale the person.
The person scaled Zilliqa.

And now they are everywhere
and nowhere
at once.
